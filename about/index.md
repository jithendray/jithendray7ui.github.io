I'm a final year CS undergrad at Indian Institute of Information Technology, Jabalpur passionate about data science and machine learning research. My research interests include **Machine Learning** and **Time series forecasting**.

Currently, Iâ€™m interning as a Data Scientist @ [NeenOpal](), which is a global management consulting firm with a unique and specialized focus on Data Science based out in Banglore.



In the past, I've taken an interest in high performance deep learning on FPGA's and statistical modeling for time series. During my undergraduation I designed a [Neural Network accelerator](https://github.com/tirumalnaidu/opencl-cnn-accelerator) on Intel CycloneV SoC FPGA using High Level Synthesis tools and languages. I also worked on forecasting project under [Prof. Sunil Agrawal](http://faculty.iiitdmj.ac.in/faculty/sa) where I forecasted Onion arrival to Mumbai (a city in India) markets from farmers.<!--I also worked on Autism detection in toddlers using machine learning techniques under [Prof.Anupam Agrawal](https://it.iiita.ac.in/?pg=facultypage&uid=anupam).-->



In the summer of 2019, I was a visiting researcher at [HCI Lab](https://hci.iiita.ac.in/labs.html), IIIT Allahabad working on early detection of Autism in toddlers using Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I was fortunate enough to work under the amazing mentorship of [Prof. Anupam Agrawal](https://it.iiita.ac.in/?pg=facultypage&uid=anupam).



I spend my time analysing some publicly available data, reading research papers and [writing](https://jbsy.github.io/blog/). I spend my liesure time mostly banging my head to some heavy metal and some times I read books. Unfortunately, 2020 compelled me to blog about my weird music taste. I started writing my personal thoughts and impressions on Metal bands and their albums on [Medium](https://mettal-musings.blogspot.com/).



I actively publish code to [GitHub](https://github.com/jithendrabsy). I'm also active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jithendrabsy) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jithendrabsy/). If you think me (or my projects) are interesting feel free to contact me! You can also mail me at [jithendra1230@gmail.com](mailto:jithendra1230@gmail.com). I'm always interested in hearing about new opportunities to collaborate and work on machine learning projects or hackathons.
